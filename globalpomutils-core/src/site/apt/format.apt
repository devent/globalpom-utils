Duration Simple Format

  * <<<com.anrisoftware.globalpom.core.external.format.durationsimpleformat.DurationSimpleFormatFactory>>>

  Factory to create a new simple duration format.

  * <<<com.anrisoftware.globalpom.core.external.format.durationsimpleformat.DurationSimpleFormat>>>

  Formats and parses simple duration.

  * <<<com.anrisoftware.globalpom.core.external.format.durationsimpleformat.DurationSimpleFormatModule>>>

  Installs the simple duration format factory.

  * <<<com.anrisoftware.globalpom.core.external.format.durationsimpleformat.UnitMultiplier>>>

  Duration unit multiplier.

  Formats and parses simple duration. The duration format is <<<value[Unit]>>>,
where the <<<value>>> is the integer value of the duration and the <<<Unit>>>
is the one of the time unit <<<ms, s, m, h, d, w, M, y>>> for milliseconds,
seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years, respectively.

  * <<<64>>>

  * <<<64ms>>>

  * <<<64s>>>

  * <<<64m>>>

  * etc.

* Example

  Example using static import.

---
import static com.anrisoftware.globalpom.core.external.format.duration.DurationFormat.createDurationFormat;

public class Foo {

    public long parseDuration(String duration) {
        return createDurationFormat().parse(duration);
    }

    public String formatDuration(long duration, UnitMultiplier multiplier) {
        return createDurationFormat().format(duration, multiplier);
    }
}
---

  Example using Guice and injecting the format factory.

---
public class Foo {

    @Inject
    private DurationSimpleFormatFactory durationSimpleFormatFactory;

    public long parseDuration(String duration) {
        return durationSimpleFormatFactory.create().parse(duration);
    }

    public String formatDuration(long duration, UnitMultiplier multiplier) {
        return durationSimpleFormatFactory.create().format(duration, multiplier);
    }
}
