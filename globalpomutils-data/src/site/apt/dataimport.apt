// create default CSV import properties
DefaultCsvImportProperties prop = injector.getInstance(DefaultCsvImportProperties.class);
// sets the file to read
prop.setFile(lottoFile);
CsvImporterFactory factory = injector.getInstance(CsvImporterFactory.class);
CsvImporter importer = factory.create(prop);
// reads first values row from the file
importer.call()
List<String> row = importer.getValues();
